This neglects the privacy-preserving policy, that is, all the data and computations must be kept decentralized. There exists three problems in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the domain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from source and target domains, which is not accessible. (2) The communication cost and privacy security limit the application of UMDA methods (e.g., the domain adversarial training). (3) Since users have no authority to check the data quality, the irrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes negative transfer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving UMDA paradigm named Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation (KD3A), which performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models from different source domains. KD3A solves the above problems with three components: (1) A multi-source knowledge distillation method named Knowledge Vote to learn high-quality domain consensus knowledge. (2) A dynamic weighting strategy named Consensus Focus to identify both the malicious and irrelevant domains. (3) A decentralized optimization strategy for domain distance named BatchNorm MMD. The extensive experiments on DomainNet demonstrate that KD3A is robust to the negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication cost compared with other decentralized UMDA methods. Moreover, our KD3A significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches.","tags":["Domain Adaptation","Knowledge Distillation"],"title":"location2vec: a situation-aware representation for visual exploration of urban locations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiacheng Pan","Wei Chen","Xiaodong Zhao","Minfeng Zhu","Jian Chen","Siwei Fu","Yingcai Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612656000,"objectID":"9c1373174d5392c9615f931a01e64c37","permalink":"https://minfengzhu.github.io/publication/examplerlayout/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/examplerlayout/","section":"publication","summary":"We design and evaluate a novel layout fine-tuning technique for node-link diagrams that facilitates exemplar-based adjustment of a group of substructures in batching mode.

However, the data uncertainty imposes profound challenges to fulfill advanced analytics requirements. On the one hand, many underlying data does not contain accurate geographic coordinates, e.g., positions of a mobile phone only refer to the regions (i.e., mobile cell stations) in which it resides, instead of accurate GPS coordinates. On the other hand, domain experts and general users prefer a natural way, such as using a natural language sentence, to access and analyze massive movement data. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that can extract spatial-temporal constraints from a textual sentence and support an effective query method over uncertain mobile trajectory data. It is built up on encoding massive, spatially uncertain trajectories by the semantic information of the POls and regions covered by them, and then storing the trajectory documents in text database with an effective indexing scheme. The visual interface facilitates query condition specification, situation-aware visualization, and semantic exploration of large trajectory data. Usage scenarios on real-world human mobility datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","tags":["Urban data","Visual Analysis","Spatio-temporal","Natural Language"],"title":"A Natural-language-based Visual Query Approach of Uncertain Human Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minfeng Zhu","Pingbo Pan","Wei Chen","and Yi Yang."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585813562,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585813562,"objectID":"085a1a8b4fcc9c17df6936522de234f7","permalink":"https://minfengzhu.github.io/publication/eemefn/","publishdate":"2020-04-02T15:46:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eemefn/","section":"publication","summary":"This work focuses on the extremely low-light image enhancement, which aims to improve image brightness and reveal hidden information in darken areas. Recently, image enhancement approaches have yielded impressive progress. However, existing methods still suffer from three main problems: (1) low-light images usually are high-contrast. Existing methods may fail to recover images details in extremely dark or bright areas; (2) current methods cannot precisely correct the color of low-light images; (3) when the object edges are unclear, the pixel-wise loss may treat pixels of different objects equally and produce blurry images. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method called Edge-Enhanced Multi-Exposure Fusion Network (EEMEFN) to enhance extremely low-light images. In the first stage, we employ a multi-exposure fusion module to address the high contrast and color bias issues. We synthesize a set of images with different exposure time from a single image and construct an accurate normal-light image by combining well-exposed areas under different illumination conditions. Thus, it can produce realistic initial images with correct color from extremely noisy and low-light images. Secondly, we introduce an edge enhancement module to refine the initial images with the help of the edge information. Therefore, our method can reconstruct high-quality images with sharp edges when minimizing the pixel-wise loss. Experiments on the See-in-the-Dark dataset indicate that our EEMEFN approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.","tags":["Low-light Image Enhancement"],"title":"EEMEFN: Low-Light Image Enhancement via Edge-Enhanced Multi-Exposure Fusion Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Current methods first generate an initial image with rough shape and color, and then refine the initial image to a high-resolution one. Most existing text-to-image synthesis methods have two main problems. (1) These methods depend heavily on the quality of the initial images. If the initial image is not well initialized, the following processes can hardly refine the image to a satisfactory quality. (2) Each word contributes a different level of importance when depicting different image contents, however, unchanged text representation is used in existing image refinement processes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (DM-GAN) to generate high-quality images. The proposed method introduces a dynamic memory module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well generated. A memory writing gate is designed to select the important text information based on the initial image content, which enables our method to accurately generate images from the text description. We also utilize a response gate to adaptively fuse the information read from the memories and the image features. We evaluate the DM-GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our DM-GAN model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.","tags":["Generative Adversarial Networks","Text-to-Image Synthesis"],"title":"DM-GAN: Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minfeng Zhu","Wei Chen","Jiazhi Xia","Yuxin Ma","Yankong Zhang","Yuetong Luo","Zhaosong Huang","Liangjun Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1552296004,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552296004,"objectID":"6de916936e6e1d6592d35c0d0ceb4176","permalink":"https://minfengzhu.github.io/publication/location2vec/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T17:20:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/location2vec/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the relationship between urban locations is an essential task in urban planning and transportation management.

In this paper, we design and implement a novel visual analytics approach, Visual Analyzer for Urban Data (VAUD), that supports the visualization, querying, and exploration of urban data. Our approach allows for cross-domain correlation from multiple data sources by leveraging spatial-temporal and social inter-connectedness features. Through our approach, the analyst is able to select, filter, aggregate across multiple data sources and extract information that would be hidden to a single data subset. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide case studies on a real urban dataset that contains the cyber-, physical-, and socialinformation of 14 million citizens over 22 days.","tags":["Urban data","Visual Analysis","Visual Reasoning","Heterogeneous","Spatio-temporal"],"title":"VAUD: A visual analysis approach for exploring spatio-temporal urban data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tianlong Gu","Minfeng Zhu","Wei Chen","Zhaosong Huang","Ross Maciejewski","and Liang Chang."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533195962,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533195962,"objectID":"74f997771a1ca6d75fc235b2958d0447","permalink":"https://minfengzhu.github.io/publication/amtg/","publishdate":"2018-08-02T15:46:02+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/amtg/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling human mobility is a critical task in fields such as urban planning, ecology, and epidemiology. Given the current use of mobile phones, there is an abundance of data that can be used to create models of high reliability. Existing techniques can reveal the macro-patterns of crowd movement or analyze the trajectory of a person; however, they typically focus on geographical characteristics. This paper presents a graph-based approach for structuring crowd mobility transition over multiple granularities in the context of social behavior. The key to our approach is an adaptive data representation, the adaptive mobility transition graph, that is globally generated from citywide human mobility data by defining the temporal trends of human mobility and the interleaved transitions between different mobility patterns. We describe the design, creation and manipulation of the adaptive mobility transition graph and introduce a visual analysis system that supports the multi-faceted exploration of citywide human mobility patterns.","tags":["Timeline","Mobility","Mobility Transition","Mobility Patterns"],"title":"Structuring Mobility Transition With an Adaptive Graph Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
